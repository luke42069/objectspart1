Testing Theory
==============

Goals of Testing: 
1) "Complete Code Coverage": It's impossible for every line in your code
to be executed in 1 run (if statements, etc). The goal is to ensure 
that every line gets run at least once. Requires several trials dependant
on the length of your code. 
2) Efficiency: Testers want to avoid using test data that belongs 
to the same "Equivalence Class" - Data that will send you down the same
path of execution each time you run the program.

Strategies:
1) Test around "Boundary Conditions" - Data that falls right on or near
boundaries. Ex: number must be 10 to 20, so test 9,10,11,19,20,21.
2)Test with "Extreme Conditions" - Data that is far away from acceptable
limits. Ex: test 10000000 or -1000000

Testing Payroll Interface
Boundaries:
Type - try 0, 1, 2, 3
Rate - try 6.74, 6.75, 30.50, 30.51
Hours - try -1, 0, 1, 59, 60, 61

Extremes: fucking obvious
Type - try -1000, +1000
Rate - try -100 and +100
Hours - try -100 and +100
